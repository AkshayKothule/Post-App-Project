##Add new Project on Git Hub

â€¦or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# Post-App-Project" >> README.md
git init

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/AkshayKothule/Post-App-Project.git

git push -u origin main

###Environment variable

```javascript
create use react app

These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE will be access in your JS as process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE.

create app wite vite app
To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your Vite-processed code

Only VITE_SOME_KEY will be access as import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY to your client source code

```

## hooks
```javascript

forwardRef :-
the forwardRef hook is a utility function that passes a ref from a component to one of its children. This allows you to access a ref further down the DOM tree.

In the example below, if we try passing a ref as a prop from the App component to the SubmitButton component, we'll get an error in the console.

You can use forwardRef to expose DOM nodes inside a component to its parent component.

You can use forwardRef to access child-defined properties or methods in the parent component.
